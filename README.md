# Introduction
`BDSpyrunner` is a plug-in loader for `BDS` (Bedrock Dedicated Server).
It uses CPython and Detours to connect Python and BDS so that Python can operate some things in Minecraft.
It greatly reduces the threshold for plug-in development and effectively simplifies the cost of plug-in development.
# Usage
1. Download `BDSpyrunner.dll` and `BDSpyrunner.pdb` in `Release` (optional).
2. Go to https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe to download and install `Python3.7.9`, remember to check add to `Environment Variables`.
2. Put the dll into the `./plugins` folder, run BDS, the py folder will be automatically generated, if you see `[BDSpyrunner] x.x.x loaded.`, the pyr has been loaded successfully.
7. Put the plug-in into `./plugins/py`, run BDS again, you can use it normally.
